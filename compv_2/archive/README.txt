This directory contains a selection of VTK example
Python scripts, and three datasets.

The Python scripts are derived on examples from the 
public VTK release (see www.vtk.org) although these
have been modified, sometimes substantially, for 
the purpose of the Hartree course.

The dataset "fuel.raw" comes from the volvis 
repository, www.volvis.org.

The datasets combq.bin and combxyz.bin come from
the public VTK release and should not be 
distributed - please see the enclosed copyright
notice from the VTKData directory.
