### Hello, 

This is Yingjie's *Latex* documents archive repo. And all the documents here are my real homeworks. 

My initial idea is that I create a branch per document and then I merge it back to the master branch and let's see if it can work.

I hope it can help some one in need, and I specifically included all the images and files just to make it an 'one-click' compiling process.

At the main time, I released my related [Evernote notebook](https://www.evernote.com/pub/y1275963/latex) and once again I hope I can help someone just like those who helped me.

My personal experience with *Latex*:

1. I started *Latex* with the series short tutorials created by **Michelle Krummel**, and the link is: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1D4EAB31D3EBC449. I finished it in one week and I almost had immemediately applied them all to my work. This is short and very helpful.

2. As I moved on, I always get new demands and I search for and sovle them and finally archive them inside my Evernote so I can apply to them right away. I have currently developed a template of my own(it is within my evernote and my later latex documents) and the starting of my homework always accomplied with the starting with copy/paste my Latex template.

3. My current editor is [Texpad](https://www.texpadapp.com/). I knew it is not Vim nor Emacs but I have never felt inefficiency and using this simple editor helps me concentrate more on the homework itself and keep the whole process very simple and easy to get start.

4. The main reason why I want to *version control* my documents is that I want to keep a record of my homeworks so I can *checkout* when in need.


Do please let me know if there is anything I can help concering *Latex*.
