The answers to question a:

Description:
        I used grid search method to solve this question. The so called grid search method is to split the range (-400,-400) to (400,400) into multiple grid and use each grid at the testing point.
        In total, I use the interval of 10 and split it into a grid of 81*81 which will produce 6561 results in all.
        
        The following is the description of the function of the attached script:

        1.grid_search_q2a.m: This script do grid search and store the answers into a cell called answ, as well as the solving exitflag called flag and the solving function result called f. 
        And by analyzing the result we can see that only 4 exitflags exist in the final answer: 0,1,-2,4. 1 and 4 stand for success and the related f values are significantly small. And -2,0 stand for fail and the related f values are pretty large. This function also eliminate those points where flag equals to -2 and 0;

        2.answ_val_mesh: This script visualize the generated results. We can clearly see from the attached pitcure from p1.fig that in total 3 different results is generated. And by looking at the picture called p2.fig, we can see the region where can let fsolve success in generated the result and vice versa.
        And by analyzing the result I split the region into 3 categories and calculate its average values one by one, which is the following:
                
                answer1 : [-293.5926,-350,0862]
                answer2 : [201.0316,253.2789]
                answer3 : [34.1561,119.0978]

        3.show_case_q2a.m and cal_dist.m are for the following answer.

        The correct answer should be answer2. I have 2 justification for that:
        1. I draw out the situation using the function called show_case_q2a.m which gives us the hints that answer2 is the right one. The related plotting is called p3.fig.
        2. I use the cal_dist.m to calculate the distance between transmitters (A,B,C) and answer1,2,3 and we can see only answer2 has the correct value for the parameter called "Measured distance to object"

        Due to the concerning of the time costing I cancelled the output for iteration from the fsolve function, but I do have successfully recorded the convergence into the file called convergence.


The answers to question b:

Due to the error within the data, we can not guarantee the correctness of the data itself. This simple method treat the error itself as a variable and successfully convert the over determining question( 2 variables and 3 functions) into a fixed answer question. The error e stand for the error due to the natural characteristic of the problem itself like we cannot get a 100% percent correct distances and we must will have some error over the recording of the data and the error within the transmitting of the data etc..

The error can be minimized by improving the quality of the data as we can see from question b(ii).

And as we can see from the formula, the meaning of error e is in fact assuming that all the error was generated by da, and accepting the error means if we correct the data da by that error e we can get a correct answer. I drew a few diagram to illustrate this point. The picture called "q2b_1.tif" illustrate what is the error e's actual meaning in terms of question b(ii)(1).(The matlab format of this picture is called q2b_1.fig and it is generated by the script called show_case_q2a.m)

The combination of the (x,y) means the location of the ship on condition accepting that there are certain amount of error within the da which is calculated along with solving the nonlinear system.

In solving the actually problem, I used teacher's script called "continuation" to give the problem a good initial guess and then I put generated initial guess into newton method and finally I used the line search method to increase the convergence area. All of this was organized by the file called conpnewl.m.

Because I notice the 3 data was quite similar to the data in question a and I am confident with the convergence area of the method, I just used the answer from question a as the starting point which is [201.0316,253.2789] and I assume the starting point for error e is 0.

The generated answers are as follow:

q2b_1:
x  199.9756
y  253.1250
e    3.1250
q2b_2:
x  200.7137
y  253.8750
e    0.8775
q2b_3:
x  201.2004
y  253.4986
e   -0.0044

There are two things worth noticing, first error e can be negative that means the inital data for da is too large. Second, as the quality of data improves, the error e itself decreases and the accuracy of (x,y) is increasing.

The convergence data are the following files:q2b_1_convergence,q2b_2_convergence,q2b_3_convergence
